# Learn Redux

A simple React + Redux implementation of instagram. I used this to learn the principles and methodologies of a Redux + React ecosystem.


## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
